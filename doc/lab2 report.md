## Tutorial: 

### Tutorial Accelerometers:
> Q. How many bits is your ADC? Try connecting your A0 pin to 3.3V. How did you calculate the bits?

> A. 

> Q. What is the resting value of the accelerometer when it is laying face up. Why is it not 0? What is this value in terms of volts (remember that 3.3V is the maximum).

> A. 

> Q. Tap the accelerometer light, medium, and hard. What is the average value of each tap? How did you calculate this? Please donâ€™t ask us if you are tapping correctly, use your judgement :) Show a screenshot of the accelerometer plotting and tapping at different strengths.
